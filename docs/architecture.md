## Demo Simulation Workflow

```mermaid

    autonumber
    actor Judge as Faculty / Jury
    participant Dashboard as React Dashboard
    participant API as FastAPI Backend
    participant Sim as Simulation Engine
    participant ML as LightGBM Forecaster
    participant PuLP as PuLP MILP Scheduler

    Judge->>Dashboard: Click [Simulate Peak Demand]
    Dashboard->>API: POST /api/simulate/peak
    API->>Sim: Inject 12 EVs at HITEC City Hub (ST01)
    Sim->>ML: Predict future congestion risk (15-120 min)
    ML-->>Sim: Congestion risk = 95%
    Sim-->>API: High queue (8+ EVs), wait = 84 min, price = ₹23.5/kWh
    API-->>Dashboard: State updated (Alert banner & red pulse)

    Judge->>Dashboard: Click [Run ChargeFlow Optimisation]
    Dashboard->>API: POST /api/simulate/optimize
    API->>Sim: Allocate EVs via 5-factor scoring
    Sim->>PuLP: Solve Grid-Aware Power Scheduling MILP
    PuLP-->>Sim: Power allocated subject to transformer limits
    Sim-->>API: Delta comparison calculated
    API-->>Dashboard: Before vs After metrics (Wait: -100%, Overloads: 0)
```
